config IWLXVT
	tristate "Enable XVT op_mode"
	depends on IWLWIFI
	select IWLWIFI_DEVICE_TESTMODE
	select IWLWIFI_SUPPORT_DEBUG_OVERRIDES
	help
	  This option enables the xVT operation mode. xVT mode supports
	  special debug and testing operations that are not supported in
	  the standard operation modes, and is used for verification
	  purposes.
	  xVT mode does not support the standard WiFi operations, and
	  does not communicate with the user mode through the nl80211.

	  Enabling this options allows to fully control the HW using
	  an external tool in user space.

	  Say Y if you have the user space application and want
	  to execute debug and testing flows on the HW.

	  Enable 11ax softap testmode debugfs entries that can be used to

	  testmode client.

config IWLMVM_ADVANCED_QUOTA_MGMT
	bool "enable advanced quota management code"
	default y
	depends on IWLMVM
	help
	  This code isn't intended to go upstream yet, hence
	  the config option. You shouldn't turn it off.

config IWLWIFI_THERMAL_DEBUGFS

	default y
	help
	  Enable thermal settings debugfs entries that can be used to change
	  the temperatures and other parameters for testing, This code isn't
	  intended for upstream, hence the config option. You shouldn't turn it off.

	  This option force the FW to transmit OFDM rate.

	  If unsure say N, Say Y if you have this code and want to transmit OFDM low rate.

config IWLMVM_P2P_OPPPS_TEST_WA
	bool "Use WA to pass P2P OPPPS certification test"
	depends on IWLMVM
	---help---
	  This option enables a WA to pass P2P OPPPS certification test.
	  This test verifies P2P client power management behavior when
	  connected to P2P GO that advertises OPPPS. Since P2P client power
	  management is not supported currently by FW a special WA is required.
	  Send zeroed quota on P2P client MAC if power save is enabled from
	  user space to mimic power management behavior. Update quota to normal
	  value otherwise.

config IWLMVM_VENDOR_CMDS
	bool "enable vendor commands"
	depends on IWLMVM
	default y
	help
	  This option enables support for vendor commands, including some
	  that don't have their own Kconfig option. Other Kconfig options
	  depend on this one as well.

	  This option mostly exists for non-upstream tagging, so best
	  leave it set to Y.

config IWLMVM_VENDOR_TCM_EVENTS
	bool "enable TCM vendor events"
	depends on IWLMVM_VENDOR_CMDS
	default y
	help
	  This option enables vendor TCM events to userspace that can
	  be used to adjust certain parameters depending on the
	  traffic conditions.  These events can become rather noisy
	  with standard wpa_supplicant, since it prints out 3 debug
	  messages every time the event is received (as an unknown
	  event).  When used with standard wpa_supplicant, it is
	  recommended to disable this option.

config IWLMVM_TDLS_PEER_CACHE

	  This option enables (vendor) commands from userspace to monitor

	  might be TDLS peers, or candidates to become such.

config IWLWIFI_DISALLOW_OLDER_FW

	depends on IWLWIFI
	help
	  This Kconfig option allows disabling fallback to older firmware images
	  to ensure tight coupling between driver and firmware releases. When
